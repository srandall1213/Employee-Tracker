# Employee-Tracker

## Description

My motivation in completing this project was to apply what I learned this week about Mysql. I built this project because I wanted to test my skills and see if I could be effective in creating an Employee Tracker. The Employee Tracker solves the problem of being able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in a company. Through this project I learned more about how to work databases, tables, node and inquirer combined. I faced a few  challenges with this project, but I mostly struggled with getting the syntax correct, getting my queries to show what I needed, and trying to figure out how to show the question choices as strings while needing to use the responses as integers to update the database.  

## Future Development

In the future, I would like to figure out how to show strings as choices in Inquirer when adding/updating an employee while using that response to update the database. Right now, some of the choices are integers so that I can update my table correctly. There is also one question that only shows last names of employees as choices. I would like to figure out how to concatenate the names to display as full names. 

The following nested questions need adjustments: 
- Add a role>Which department ID does the role belong to?
- Add an employee>What is the employee's role ID? AND What is the employee's manager ID?
- Update an employee role>Which employee's role do you want to update? AND Which role ID do you want to assign the selected employee?
